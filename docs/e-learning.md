# E-learning guide

This document contains a set of guidelines on the proper use of the available e-learning tools.

Post any question about this guide as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/isel-leic-pc/s2021i-li51d-li51n/issues).

## Slack

The Slack workspace is named `isel-leic-pc` and the invitation URL will be available in Moodle.

This Slack workspace will only be monitored by the teaching staff during the scheduled lecture hours and eventual additional _office-hours_ (i.e. extra time slots booked outside the regular scheduled lecture hours).

The available channels are:

- A `#general` channel used by the teaching staff to broadcast information applicable to all class sections ("turmas").

- A channel specific to each class section ("turma"), for more scoped announcements and discussions.

- A per-group private channel, used for group-related conversations, mainly during the scheduled lecture hours.

## GitHub issues

Use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/isel-leic-pc/s2021i-li51d-li51n/issues) on the common repository to request help that can be handled asynchronously:

- Note that the GitHub issues are public and viewable by all class members. Use them mainly for questions that are relevant to the overall community.

- Do not include private information.

- Always include your class section ("turma") in the issue description.

## Colibri - Zoom

We will use the [Colibri](https://videoconf-colibri.zoom.us) service, based on the Zoom platform, to host and run remote lectures and meetings.
There will be two meeting types:

- Lectures, used by the teaching staff to address all students (e.g. present a new subject or answers general questions). The links to these meetings will be publish via Moodle and via Slack.

- Per-student meetings. These meetings should be requested by the students, during the scheduled lecture periods (or additional office-hours), by sending a private Slack message, and including the Colibri/Zoom meeting link.

### Attending a lecture or meeting

- After obtaining the meeting URL, just click on it or use it in a browser. This will typically ask permission to launch the `zoom.us` application, or install if that wasn't done before. Unfortunately, this dedicated Zoom application is required to attend Colibri/Zoom meetings.

- The first time the Zoom application is used, you will have the opportunity to check and/or configure audio settings.

- **Do not login into Colibri/Zoom** before attending a lecture or meeting, to avoid using Colibri licenses. No authentication is required to attend a meeting, given its link.

- When joining a meeting keep the **microphone muted**. Un-mute microphone upon host indication.

- You may have the webcam on or off. To improve the lectures, I like to have at least two or three students with the webcams on.

- Lectures _may_ be recorded and made available publicly. This means that:
- Any audio questions and comments made by the attendees will be available in the public recordings.
- The webcam feeds may also be available in the public recordings.
- There will be periods at the beggining and end of each lecture without any recording. Feel free to use them to ask questions or make any comment.

- There is NO guarantee that all lectures will be made available publicly.

### Requesting a meeting

- Login into Zoom, using the SSO (Single-Sign-On) authentication method, the `videoconf-colibri.zoom.us` company domain, and the IPL identity provider. Use your IPL email credentials, **only on the IPL identity provider**.

- Use Slack's private messages to request a meeting.
